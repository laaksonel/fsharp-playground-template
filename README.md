# Playground for F# tinkering

Just a simple devcontainer setup for running F# notebooks in VSCode.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Open the repo in VSCode
4. VSCode should show a prompt about switching the dev environment into remote devcontainer.

Now all the required plugins are automatically installed inside the container based on the contents of `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
